    Title: 'Celestial Age',
    Length: '6:58',
    Lyrics: `A great expanse of blackened ground, pestilence, and decay
    Has conquered all we ever knew
    As tendrils of ice grip our burning hearts

    The aether opens now to us, we have been thrust to a celestial age
    For we beheld death and its eyes showed reflections of our home

    As we breathe in the wonders of stars we’ve always seen
    The void before us is now gone, replaced by the beauty of Saturn
    We are approaching what has been our dream for centuries
    Titan brings us promise, though what have we left behind?

    Hope!
    A remnant of our past, now returned to us at last.
    Light!
    From a more distant sun, though it remains one we have always known

    O, witness the sky, unseen by mortal eyes
    A giant on the horizon and grandeur above

    Can we truly hope for a life as we’ve known it?
    Or have we been cursed to live on in insanity?
    From Huygens to apocalypse, the torches now lit
    11 AU from all we held as reality
  
    Everything we are is gathered here on a cold and distant moon
    I fear that chaos beckons, I see the shadow of despair
    Time is slipping swiftly. 15 days of cold, 15 of frost
    We must endure, we cannot fall, there is already too much lost

    The aether opens now to us, we have been thrust to a celestial age
    For we beheld death, and its eyes showed reflections of our home (x2)`

  Rebirth: {
    Title: 'Rebirth in the Stars',
    Length: '11:20',
    Lyrics: `I stand here among the dreams of a thousand men
    Why have I been chosen to ascend while the masses writhe in fire?
    The torment of this loss is not quelled by our grand rebirth in the stars

    Men of the Earth now lost, have our wounds been healed by time?
    Though the years have passed, I still see the faces of those we left
    And as we pretend to thrive one billion miles from our pain
    I feel my rage arise and I fear the walls are closing in

    I know this - our chance at peace is dead
    And this facade of great virtue begins to sicken me
    So burn it

    What fresh hell is this? We are trapped in a cage
    Beleaguered on all sides by vicious murderers and thieves
    I would see no more of this, we’ve all suffered enough
    Let us bring this chaos down, order begins now

    Raze it to the ground, it cannot grow darker than it is now
    Bleed, you callous carrion, we bring justice to the murderer’s crown

    I know this - your treachery has brought
    Discord upon that which saved us all
    Now we will end this
    
    The light returns, the fires die
    Now join me and hail the dawn
    
    I live yet, and still breathe
    There is no darkness, but all the color is gone
    I see naught but endless waves of grey
    Trust in us, you shall not die, perform your duty, you shall not want
    Everything is under control
    We have paired you with another to ensure idyllic life
    Everything is under control
    Do not stray
    We have made perfection real, now trust in us

    Men of the Earth now lost, how bleak have your lives now grown?
    All risk and reward has gone, we simply comply and carry on
    Where does emotion hide in this poor rendition of a life?
    I suspect I will be silenced soon, but ideas are not so easily quelled

    I know this - breath does not make a life
    I have felt nothing so long yet now I fill with rage
    So burn it.`,

  Home: {
    Title: 'Home',
    Length: '5:52',
    Lyrics: `Home was never so strange a thought
    All I long to return to is now bleak, dark, dead
    Here we have peace, we have life, we have comfort and purpose
    So why do I still feel so far from where I’m meant?

    Here we begin again, the lands that shaped us left behind
    We come from a great and bright world, colored by stories and songs
    And I fear we may be lost

    I yearn for the forests of my youth
    As I watched them grow before me, my heart did not sing as once it had
    Would that I grow fond of fire
    That I may find my hope in the burning of our past

    Here we begin again, the lands that shaped us left behind
    Yet we have a chance

    We come from a great and bright world, colored by stories and songs
    And we bring them with us

    So! What are we now?
    But a collection of wayward doomed souls? No!
    Apocalypse took from us all we held dear
    But spared us our being, our knowledge, our lore

    Dark may be the tales made where we stand, yet they shall be made nonetheless

    Done is the age that we knew for all our lives
    Yet we live on to the next

    Here we begin again, the lands that shaped us left behind
    Though in our eyes they dance

    Though the ground we walk is yet unnamed, we bring life to it
    Though it shall never replace what we lost, we may shape it

    We come from a great and bright world, colored by stories and songs
    And we are the first to color this one
    
    Now we shall sing songs
    And now we shall write songs of home`,
