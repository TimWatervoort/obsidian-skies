  BioLine1: `Obsidian Skies was founded amidst the turmoil of 2020 by Logan Dougherty and Tim Watervoort. The two had worked together before, but not since the breakup of their previous band, Endlight, in 2017. Logan and Tim wrote much of Endlight’s music, with Logan on guitars and Tim on bass and vocals. They performed throughout Colorado, sharing the stage with bands such as Unleash the Archers and Archspire until the band’s end. While they remained close friends, Tim and Logan’s musical and professional paths diverged for a time at this point.`,
  BioLine2: `During this time, Logan attained a Bachelor’s degree in Music Composition, adding to his Physics and Astrophysics degrees. He released a solo orchestral album, “Kingdom of Sand” in 2017, and had his chamber works performed at the University of Colorado College of Music. Tim completed his Master’s degree in Linguistics and went through an accelerated full-stack web development program. He performed as a vocalist for Oak, Ash & Thorn for a time in 2018, sharing the stage with bands such as Týr and Alestorm. Following this, he focused his musical attention on bass and solo metal work.`,
  BioLine3: `When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and everyone was stuck indoors, the two looked for a project to work on, half to stay sane, and half to explore a new creative outlet. At this time, Obsidian Skies was born. It started with Tim and Logan sharing parts with each other that they had previously written. However, as time went on, it became a true collaborative writing process, with the two writing each song together. Their first release, “Saturnian”, is absolutely some of the best work either has ever produced.`,
  BioLine4: `Both Tim and Logan are influenced by progressive and technical death metal, listening to bands such as Fleshgod Apocalypse, Alkaloid, and Ne Obliviscaris. Composers such as Rachmaninoff, Bach, and Debussy strongly influence Logan, as well as more modern composers like John Williams and Howard Shore. Tim is heavily influenced by folk and melodic death metal bands such as Eluveitie and Insomnium, and is inspired by great bass players such as Dominic Lapointe and Linus Klausenitzer.`,
  BioLine5: `The music of Obsidian Skies spans many different genres, not all of which are metal. While harsh vocals, fast rhythms, and guitar solos are featured prominently, they do not necessarily dominate. Sweeping orchestral melodies, clean singing, and instruments such as piano, acoustic guitar, and fretless bass contribute to the music to create a melodic and diverse sound.`,
  BioLine6: `Lyrically, the band’s themes are heavily influenced by science fiction and fantasy. The story of “Saturnian” takes place on Saturn’s moon Titan. In this story, humanity is forced to flee from a dying Earth, and a portion of the population colonizes Titan. While life is able to flourish there, the people who survived are forced to deal with the emotions of leaving their lost home and the guilt of abandoning those who could not leave the planet.`,
  BioLine7: `Obsidian Skies remains a studio band for now, but that has allowed for flexibility in tracking that would have been difficult to achieve as a brand-new live band. “Rebirth in the Stars”, for instance, has multiple sections with four or more guitar tracks and several orchestral layers. Their debut EP “Saturnian” is set to release in 2022 and will deliver an elaborate story with a diverse, but undoubtedly metal, sound.`,
